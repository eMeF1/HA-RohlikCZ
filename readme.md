> **What is Rohlík.cz?**  
> Rohlík.cz is one of the most popular online grocery and food-delivery services in the Czech Republic (also operating as Knuspr in Germany and Austria, and Kifli.hu in Hungary). They deliver fresh groceries, household goods and more — often within hours.

> [!WARNING]
> This integration uses a reverse-engineered API from the Rohlík.cz website. It is **not** officially supported by Rohlík.cz. Use it at your own risk.

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1 — HACS (Recommended)

Install in one click via the Home Assistant Community Store:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=dvejsada&repository=HA-RohlikCZ&category=Integration)

> Don't have HACS yet? [Get it here](https://hacs.xyz/).

### Option 2 — Manual Installation

1. Download this repository (or just the `rohlikcz` folder).
2. Copy the `rohlikcz` folder into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services** in your Home Assistant UI.
2. Click **Add Integration** (the `+` button in the bottom right).
3. Search for **Rohlik.cz** and select it.
4. Enter your Rohlík.cz credentials:
   - **Email** — your Rohlík.cz account email
   - **Password** — your Rohlík.cz account password
5. Click **Submit** — entities will be set up automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> If your password later changes or stops working, Home Assistant prompts you to re-enter it (**re-authentication**) instead of the integration silently failing. Each Rohlík.cz account can only be added once.

### Optional: Spending Analytics

After setup you can enable **Spending Analytics** at any time via the integration's **Configure** button:

- Choose which category levels to track (top-level, mid-level, detailed, most specific, per-item)
- Set how many top items to display in sensor attributes (default: 10)
- Optionally hide discontinued products from rankings

Enabling analytics triggers a one-time download of your full order history (this may take several minutes).

| **All Time Spent** | Total spent across all tracked orders *(requires Spending Analytics)*; the `by_year` attribute breaks the total down per year (`total` and `order_count` per year) |

### 📅 Calendar

**Orders Calendar** — Shows all upcoming and recent delivery windows as calendar events (entity ID typically ending in `_orders_calendar`, for example `calendar.rohlikcz_orders_calendar`; your actual ID may vary).

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Event Title** | Order number (e.g., `Order 123456789`) |
| **Event Start** | Delivery window start time |
| **Event End** | Delivery window end time |
| **Event Description** | Order status, item count, and total price |
| **State** | `on` during an active delivery window, `off` otherwise |

Events are sourced from upcoming orders and the last 50 delivered orders. Events disappear automatically once an order falls outside that window.

**Ideas for using the calendar:**
- View all deliveries in the Home Assistant calendar UI
- Trigger automations when a delivery window starts
- Query upcoming deliveries with the `calendar.get_events` service

### 💰 Spending Analytics Sensors (opt-in)

When analytics levels are enabled in the integration options, the following sensors are created (each with "this year" and "all time" variants):

- **Top Categories** (L0) - Spending by top-level categories (e.g. Drinks, Drugstore)
- **Categories** (L1) - Spending by mid-level categories (e.g. Hot drinks, Cleaning products)
- **Detailed Categories** (L2) - Spending by detailed categories (e.g. Coffee, Universal cleaner)
- **Specific Categories** (L3) - Spending by most specific categories (e.g. Bean coffee, Spray cleaner)
- **Per-Item** - Spending by individual product (e.g. Tchibo Barista, Savo Spray)

Each sensor's attributes contain the top N items (configurable, default 10) sorted by spending, with `total_count`, `spent`, `units`, and `avg_unit_price` per entry.

## 🔧 Actions (Service Calls)

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **`rohlikcz.add_to_cart`** | Add a product to your cart by product ID and quantity |
| **`rohlikcz.search_product`** | Search for products available on Rohlík.cz by name |
| **`rohlikcz.search_and_add_to_cart`** | Search for a product by name and add it to your cart in one step |
| **`rohlikcz.get_shopping_list`** | Retrieve products from a saved Rohlík.cz shopping list by its ID |

| **`rohlikcz.update_data`** | Force an immediate full data refresh from Rohlík.cz |
| **`rohlikcz.refresh_slots`** | Cheaply refresh only the delivery-slot data with a single request — light enough to poll every few seconds to catch express availability |
| **`rohlikcz.update_delivery_times`** | Cheaply refresh only the delivery-time announcement with a single request — light enough to poll every minute to track the shifting delivery ETA |
| **`rohlikcz.fetch_order_history`** | Download your complete order history and store it locally (backfill) |
| **`rohlikcz.enrich_orders`** | Enrich stored orders with item details and product categories to populate the spending sensors |

> [!TIP]
> Want a notification the moment express delivery opens up? See [`automations/refresh_slots.yaml`](automations/refresh_slots.yaml) for an example that polls `refresh_slots` every 15 seconds while armed and notifies you when the **Express Available** sensor turns on.

> [!TIP]
> Delivery ETA shifting around before the courier arrives? See [`automations/update_delivery_times.yaml`](automations/update_delivery_times.yaml) for an example that polls `update_delivery_times` every minute during the last 30 minutes before delivery so the **Delivery Time** sensor stays accurate.

---

## 🔄 Data Updates

Data is refreshed from Rohlík.cz **every 10 minutes** automatically. The update covers account details, premium status, delivery slots, shopping cart, and order history.

You can trigger an immediate refresh at any time using the **`rohlikcz.update_data`** action, refresh just the delivery slots more frequently with **`rohlikcz.refresh_slots`**, or refresh just the delivery-time announcement with **`rohlikcz.update_delivery_times`**.

## 🩺 Diagnostics

If something isn't working, download the integration's diagnostics from **Settings → Devices & Services → Rohlík.cz → ⋮ (three dots) → Download diagnostics** and attach the file to your bug report. Credentials and personal details (email, phone, name, address) are automatically redacted.
